<p><b>üõë Problems:</b></p>


<p>- Do you face the problem of having to copy settings from one spritesheet to another, and do it quickly and in bulk?</p>
- Or do you need to set the same exact Pivot for all objects in a sprite sheet, and do this not only for one sprite sheet, but for several at once?
<p></p>

<p><b>üí° Solution:</b></p>

<p>Our tool provides a convenient way to set the pivot point (Pivot) for all cutout objects in a sprite sheet. This can be done in bulk, which will save you a lot of time. You can provide individual Pivot parameters for each sprite separately and assign them, or set them in bulk so that you don't waste time on it, everything individually.</p>

<p>In addition, ease of use is ensured by the ability to open the Sprite Editor window directly from this menu, which significantly speeds up editing.</p>

<p>In addition, you have the ability to copy the values of one spritesheet to another. This can also be done in bulk, which allows you to quickly transfer values between different sprites. This is especially effective when you need to speed up the workflow with many sprites at the same time. Enjoy optimizing your work with ease!</p>
